\usage{
simulate_phenotype(gwas, snps, h2, model = "additive",
  effectSize = rnorm(length(snps)), qualitative = FALSE, ncases,
  ncontrols, prevalence)
}
\arguments{
\item{gwas}{A SnpMatrix object with the GWAS information.}

\item{snps}{Character vector with the SNP ids of the causal SNPs. Must match
SNPs in gwas[["map"]][["snp.names"]].}

\item{h2}{Heritability of the phenotype (between 0 and 1).}

\item{model}{String specifying the genetic model under the phenotype.
Accepted values: "additive".}

\item{effectSize}{Numeric vector with the same lenght as the number of causal
SNPs. It indicates the effect size of each of the SNPs; if absent, they are
sampled fron a normal distribution.}

\item{qualitative}{Bool indicating if the phenotype is qualitative or not
(quantitative).}

\item{ncases}{Integer specifying the number of cases to simulate in a
qualitative phenotype. Required if qualitative = TRUE.}

\item{ncontrols}{Integer specifying the number of controls to simulate in a
qualitative phenotype. Required if qualitative = TRUE.}

\item{prevalence}{Value between 0 and 1 specifying the population prevalence
of the disease. Note that ncases cannot be greater than 
prevalence * number of samples. Required if qualitative = TRUE.}
}
\value{
A copy of the GWAS experiment with the new phenotypes in
\code{gwas[["fam"]][["affected"]]}.
}
\description{
Simulates a phenotype from a GWAS experiment and a specified set
of causal SNPs. If the data is qualitative, only controls are used.
}
\examples{
gi <- get_GI_network(minigwas, snpMapping = minisnpMapping, ppi = minippi)
causal <- simulate_causal_snps(gi, ngenes = 2)
simulate_phenotype(minigwas, causal, h2 = 1)
